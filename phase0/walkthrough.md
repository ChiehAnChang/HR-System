# Scenario Workthrough
## _A Designed HR System for Technology Company_

> Create a **FullTimeEmployee**

Andy is the HR manager of the company Fantastic207. He opened **Command_User_Interface**, which provides a command line interface to the user for accessing the systems, that is, the program would first ask him about the account, password, and whether he wants to manage the employee or look up personal info.  He then typed his account name, password and chose to manage the employee. After getting the response, the information would be sent to **Admin_System**, which would call **Verifier**. The **Verifier** would then verify that the account exists (i.e. Andy entered the correct account name and password) and that the account has the enough authority level to manage the employee. Since both of them are true, the **Verifier** would tell **Admin_System** that the login is successful, which implies Andy is able to manage the employee, and then **Admin_System** would tell **Command_User_Interface** the login is successful, thus Andy would see that he has logged in successfully. Since **Admin_System** is the controller for the manager to operate on the use cases and it knows that Andy is a manager (i.e. able to manage the employee), Andy can now operate the **AccountManager** feature. He chose to create a **FullTimeEmployee** by entering the information of the employee in the **Command_User_Interface**, the information would be sent to Admin_System, which would send the information to **AccountManager**. **AccountManager** would then store the **FullTimeEmployee** inside **AccountManager**. Andy has successfully created a **FullTimeEmployee** at this point.
