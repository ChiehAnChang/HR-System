# Domain:
Human Resource Management System (HRM System)

# Description:
HRM System is an application designed for information technology industries that help different sectors to organize and manage the resources and their employee information. Users of this application can perform login/logout action, and according to the user's authority, the application will display different user interfaces: Admin UI and Employee UI. Admins can create or delete employee accounts if new employees join the company or employees leave their position. High-level workers (who have a high authority level) in each sector may access and edit the information stored in the system. Low-level workers (who have a low authority level) can review their personal information and distribute works that they need to complete. It also provides related support for employees to use while accomplishing their work.
